"""
Implement the classic game of Hangman, where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. 
where you will use the words from a list. use strings to represent the hidden words, a list for playerâ€™s guess and another list to track incorrect guess.
choose a random word from the list. prompt user for a letter, check if it matches with the hidden word and the list accordingly.
Show the partially revealed word and the incorrect guesses. Set conditions to determine if the player wins or loses.
